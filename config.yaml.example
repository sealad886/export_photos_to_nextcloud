# Export Photos to Nextcloud - Configuration File
#
# This YAML configuration file allows you to specify default values for the
# export-photos-to-nextcloud tool. Command line arguments will override these values.
#
# All paths support ~ expansion for home directory

# Required settings
export_dir: "~/PhotosExport"
nc_photos_dir: "~/Nextcloud/Photos"     # This is the default location used by Nextcloud Desktop
log_file: "~/export-photos.log"

# Optional settings
dry_run: false      # When true, no changes will be made
use_symlink: true   # When true, symlinks will be used instead of copies
cleanup: false      # When true, common-sense export cleanup will be performed.
                    #   This includes removing empty directories and files that are not in the export directory.
                    #   Use with caution, as it will delete files in the export directory that would not be exported using
                    #   the current configuration.
export_aae: false   # When true, AAE files will be exported (files that contain edit-data in Photos)
verbose: 0          # Verbosity level (0-2)
quiet: false        # When true, suppress most output. Overrides verbose setting.

# Example configurations:
#
# For a typical setup:
# export_dir: "~/Documents/PhotosExport"
# nc_photos_dir: "~/Nextcloud/Photos"
# log_file: "~/logs/photos-export.log"
#
# For testing with verbose output:
# dry_run: true
# verbose: 2
# quiet: false
#
# For production runs:
# cleanup: true
# export_aae: true
# verbose: 1
